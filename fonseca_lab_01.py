for k in range(1,levels + 1): #pyramid starts at 1, and ends at whatever number you entered for levels + 1.
    print("*" * k) #printing out half pyramid 


#project 2


levels = int(input("How many levels is your pyramid? ")) #ask the user how many levels is your pyramid

for k in range(0, levels): #starts at 0 to make the odd function true
    j = 2 * k + 1 #formula for an odd number
    print("*" * j) #prints out pyramid in odd increments only
#I could not figure out how to print the full pryamid unfortunately

for k in range(0, levels): #starts at 0 to make the odd function true
    j = 2 * k + 1 #formula for an odd number
    print("atttt" * j) #prints out pyramid in odd increments only
#makes a triangle with any thing you enter for a building block
